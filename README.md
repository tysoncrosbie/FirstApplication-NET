# FirstApplication .NET

I needed to come up to speed on C# and .NET and I decided to follow
this [FinShark](https://github.com/teddysmithdev/FinShark) tutorial by Teddy Smith.

Many thanks to [teddysmithdev](https://github.com/teddysmithdev) for providing the videos on YouTube.

## A road less traveled

I have decided to expand on the tutorial in my own way.

1. Choosing postgres as the database.
2. Spending some time naming things more to my preference.
3. Mostly using `record` for the DTOs.
