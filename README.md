# FirstApplication .NET 

I needed to come up to speed on C# and .NET and I decided to follow this [FinShark](https://github.com/teddysmithdev/FinShark) tutorial by Teddy Smith. 

## A road less traveled

I have decided to expand on the tutorial in my own way. 
  1. Choosing postgres as the database.
  2. Spending some time naming things more to my preference.
  3. Motly using `record` for the DTOs.
